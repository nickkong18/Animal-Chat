    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "# This Project is a chatbot focussed on animal migration patterns for four categories, Fish, Birds, Mammals, and Insects. \n",
    "# Each individual animal is stored as an instance of their specific class\n",
    "\n",
    "# This chatbot's algorithms are contained within one function, animal_chat\n",
    "    # Algorithms: I defined lists that contain \"buzzwords\" or keywords for each class attribute and additional functions\n",
    "    # The chatbot checks if the user inputted any of the keywords to determine which class attribute the user is interested in\n",
    "# If so, the corresponding output is recorded in a list that will choose an output to be printed back\n",
    "\n",
    "#Run Through of user interface\n",
    "\n",
    "#The user is first presented 2 consecutive menus, one for animal categories and one for the specific animals within each category\n",
    "# The chatbot assigns a variable to a list of animals for the respective category chosen \n",
    "# This allows the replying algorithm to be succint because I have specified which class I am refering to\n",
    "# Before analyzing the user input, the chatbot also considers if the user wants to swtich categories or end the chat  \n",
    "    #Unless the user specifies to leave or doesn't respond to the menu, the chatbot is looped to keep talking\n",
    "# I set two safety nets in case the algorithms haven't processed the user input\n",
    "    #One is random expressions\n",
    "    #The other is a ambiguous question"
